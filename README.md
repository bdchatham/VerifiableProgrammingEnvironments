# Software Integrity: Building a Secure
[Nethermind Bounty](https://ethglobal.com/events/sanfrancisco2024/prizes/nethermind)

Hello! I recentlhy joined Eigen Labs and found this problem space to be very applicable to the one I have been focused on since joining.

## Overview

Robotics & AI is rapidly becoming a disruptor of modern industry, with applications ranging from autonomous drones to warehouse robots and self-driving cars. However, the widespread deployment of these systems presents critical challenges in **coordination, security, verifiability, and resilience**. Robots often operate independently in dynamic environments, where they are vulnerable to both tampering and software bugs. Ensuring their decisions are transparent while their hardware and software remain untampered is essential for building trust in autonomous operations. 

Blockchain technology, specifically **Ethereum’s decentralized, programmable infrastructure**, offers powerful ways to address these challenges. By leveraging **cryptographic proofs and immutable data**, blockchain can ensure that robots operate with verifiable integrity throughout their lifetime. Although this design document focuses on robotics, the principles discussed here—such as **proof of machinehood**—have broader applications across other blockchain ecosystems, including solutions like EigenLayer.

## Proof of Machinehood as a Blockchain Baselayer

The concept of **proof of machinehood** introduces a blockchain-based framework for verifying the authenticity and integrity of hardware, firmware, and software. This mechanism works by cryptographically attesting to the state of a machine, ensuring that each component—whether **BIOS, operating system, or application software**—remains genuine and unaltered. Blockchain provides an immutable record where the machine can **publish attestations** about its state periodically, allowing external actors to validate that the machine has not been tampered with.

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as **Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone** would play a crucial role in enabling this process. These environments allow systems to **safely boot into a known, secure state** and execute operations within an isolated environment that is protected from external interference. As the machine serves workloads over time, it can continuously generate **machinehood attestations**, recording any relevant state changes or updates on-chain. This ensures that even as the system evolves or updates are applied, it remains in a verifiable and trusted state.

This **proof of machinehood** concept forms a foundational layer, not just for robotics but for any application environment. Cloud providers bake significant monetary cost of such security into their service fees. A network that could effectively enforce this degree of security would be an extremely desirable platform and could take some of that wealth from larger companies and distribute it to network stakeholders.

## Use Case: Amazon Warehouse Robots and Continuous Proof of Machinehood

Imagine an Amazon warehouse filled with autonomous robots resembling **WALL-E-like machines**, each tasked with organizing inventory, processing orders, and delivering packages within the facility. These robots operate independently, making critical decisions in real-time to optimize their output while working together. 

Each robot runs a **safe-boot procedure** on startup, using its TEE to verify that its **hardware components, firmware, and software stack** match the expected cryptographic signatures stored on the blockchain. If even one component—such as a sensor, motor controller, or firmware version—has been altered, the **proof of machinehood attestation will fail**, and the robot will stop operating until the issue is resolved.

Throughout its operations, the robot continues to **publish periodic attestations** of its state onto a public or permissioned blockchain. These attestations can verify that the robot’s components are running within the parameters defined at deployment. For example, an unauthorized replacement of the robot's camera sensor or motor would be detected immediately by the machinehood verification layer. This ensures that all stakeholders—whether maintenance engineers, warehouse managers, or external auditors—can **trust the robot's operation** without requiring direct oversight.

## The Societal Importance of Open and Verifiable Robotics Systems

As we move into an era where increasingly powerful robots and autonomous systems become part of daily life, it is imperative to establish a framework for determining the authenticity of these machines. An **open implementation** of proof of machinehood, accessible to all industries and developers, would significantly enhance the safety and security of autonomous systems. This becomes even more critical as the capabilities of robots grow, expanding from industrial settings into public spaces, healthcare, and defense. Like blockchain clients, multiple implementations of proof-of-machinehood may be useful to further decentralize this layer. Without a trusted and verifiable hardware and software foundation, robots will become a dangerous **vector for malicious actors**. A hacked robot could be the most dangerous piece of software humans have ever created.

The implementation of proof of machinehood as a blockchain baselayer will **limit the scope of potential harm** caused by faulty or compromised systems. This transparent and decentralized approach ensures that **society retains control over the technology** it increasingly relies on, reducing the ability for bad actors or unforeseen bugs to exploit autonomous systems.

## Actively Validated Services (AVS's), Operators and Implicit Trust

The challenges of trust and verifiability in robotics have clear parallels in blockchain protocols like EigenLayer. In EigenLayer, AVS's implicitly trust node operators to run authentic code, act honestly and maintain their infrastructure properly. However, these AVS's have no direct insight into the state of the node operators’ hardware or software, creating an opportunity for misbehavior.

Similarly, in robotics, users and stakeholders must trust that the hardware and software on autonomous machines remain unaltered and operate as intended. Both systems operate in opaque environments where the internal state of actors cannot be easily observed or verified in real time. Proof of machinehood offers a way to bridge the trust gap in both domains, allowing for continuous verification of state and behavior, whether for robots or blockchain nodes.

## Drawbacks and Shortcomings of Trusted Execution Environments

While TEEs provide a powerful tool for establishing trust in autonomous systems, they are not without their limitations. TEEs inherently rely on hardware manufacturers to provide secure environments. This introduces a degree of centralization, as the security of the system depends on the trustworthiness of the underlying hardware provider. If a manufacturer is compromised or deliberately malicious, the entire TEE could be rendered insecure.

Additionally, TEEs are a relatively new technology and have not been immune to security exploits. Researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in Intel’s SGX platform, demonstrating that even isolated execution environments are not infallible. These weaknesses highlight the importance of ongoing research and security audits to maintain the reliability of TEEs over time.

Despite these challenges, TEEs remain a critical component of verifiable autonomous systems. When combined with blockchain-based attestation mechanisms, they provide a powerful framework for enhancing the security and trustworthiness of robotics and other autonomous technologies.

## Conclusion

By leveraging*proof of machinehood and blockchain technology, we can create autonomous systems that operate with transparency, security, and resilience. This approach not only applies to robots and drones but extends to other blockchain applications such as EigenLayer, where trust in independent actors is similarly essential. While challenges remain—particularly around the centralization risks of TEEs—the combination of cryptographic attestation, safe-boot protocols, and continuous state verification offers a promising path forward for autonomous systems that are both secure and verifiable.
