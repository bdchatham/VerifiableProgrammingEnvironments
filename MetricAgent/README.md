# MachineMetricAgent
This code is very much not functional. I'm (clearly) not a Rust programmer but took a shot at this to try using TEEs to sign metric data from my host using a proof-of-machinehood. I chose Rust as Automata has a package using this SGX library and intended to work backwards from their code samples.
